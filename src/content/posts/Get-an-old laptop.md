Back in 2022 I got a new laptop. I planned on selling my old one, but lacked the time and energy to deal with dumb people on Facebook Marketplace. Time went by and never sold it. And now, I'm glad I didn't.

Having a computer you can tamper with, with absolutely no consequences, is amazing. 
The amount of things that unfolded like a domino effect after surrendering to my urge of turning that old computer into a tinkering machine has been wonderful.

After years of not touching Linux at all, I was curious to see how things had evolved. I had read a lot of good things and watched lots of YouTube videos, and I really wanted to try some things myself. I just didn't feel like going through all the hoops and loops to get a distro running on my main (desktop) PC while risking to fuck up my Windows install. Same reason I didn't want to do it on my current laptop. Both computers need to be available at any time for work-related stuff.
Suddenly, dusting off my old Acer seemed like a no brainer. So I did, and it became my gateway for switching to Linux as my main OS.

Then, two weeks ago I wanted to rip some music CDs. Ended up putting back my old DVD-RW tray in minutes and learning a bit about Abcde to rip all my CDs in FLAC with the highest quality possible. And then I added a custom cover. After finishing I just transferred everything to my desktop PC through LocalSend, as I'm rebuilding a local music library while I wait for my Snowsky Echo Mini to arrive.
Now, having undone that DVD caddy SATA adapter mod, I had a spare 1tb 2.5 HDD. I turned on my 3D printer, printed a case for the drive. Then bought a SATA to USB adapter for 3 bucks and bang, I now have an extra external drive.
Next step: designing my own case because it deserves to have some style and not being just a square boxy and boring thing.

Trust me, if you want to mess around with a computer without fearing for disaster, just get an old laptop. You will hardly regret getting one.
