title: Problem solving as a hobby (also known as 3D printing)
---

Back in August I got the urge to get a 3D printer. It wasn't my first time toying with the idea of getting one, but partially that's the reason I ended up making my mind rather quick this time.

#### "I could solve this with a 3D printer"

I've lost count on how many times I thought or said that out loud on a myriad of situations.
I've been on the verge of buying a printer many times, but there were a couple of reasons stoping me repeatedly.

#### Idealization
I tend to idealize devices and believe they're gonna solve my life problems, which has led me to buy stuff I end up not using at all. Since I'm very self aware of this, I always asked my self: "what else am I gonna print after this very speciffic set of things I want right now?". As I was unable to answer anything relevant, I instantly stoped on my tracks and quited any buying plans.
The thing is this started happening more and more often, and some months ago I realized that if I had printed all these things I wanted over the last two years, having a printer would already have been justified.

#### Embrace the struggle
The other reason was more of a question:  "Am I really willing to struggle, problem solve and learn a bunch of stuff?" Because I knew there is a lot of that on this activity.
The answer was "not really", until three months ago it became "fuck yeah".
The minute I had positive answers for those two questions I smashed that "Buy" button.
I got a Creality Ender 3 V3 KE, mostly due to it's balance between price and seeming the ideal printer for someone that wants things to just kinda work but isn't afraid to tinker and struggle if necessary.


#### Three months in
So far I've been spending time on learning how to print. That sounds simple but there's a lot on that one phrase: learning about filament is a world on it's own. Filament types, difference between brands and sub-types, pros and cons of each material, their temperatures, and a long etc. Then there's the printer's initial setup and calibration, followed by more precise calibration proccesses, and lots of tinkering with the slicer (the software you need to prep your files for your speciffic machine).

If I'm being honest, I'd say 80% of time has been problem solving and just 20% of printing things. But, eh... Isn't that how learning usually goes? I'm not unhappy. If anything, I'm happy to be enjoying the struggle so much (which I think you need to, or else you are cooked).

My end goal is to design my own models and pieces, but first I need to learn to print properly and that's where I'm currently at.
Nonetheless, having printed simple everyday use stuff like a couple headphones desk clamp holders, phone stands, or a cool looking storage rugged box, <strong>I already am convinced getting the printer was a good decision</strong>.

I should add I've been taking things very slowly. I had to deal with a ton of other things these last months. Just to clarify things would normally go faster, but, well... Life happens.

Lots more to learn, but enjoying the process!
