title: A blog about nothing

For me, personal websites are like a living thing. They allow for a level of expression that is far beyond what big corpo platforms or social media apps allow you to have. Personal sites take time and intention. They are a piece of you, floating in cyberspace.

When the "social web" started being a thingâ€”back when "Web 2.0" was the trendy term on everybody's mouthâ€”we found magical to share our everyday life with others online.

I would log onto MSN Messenger and chat with online friends from Argentina, MÃ©xico, PerÃº and Uruguay. Besides the usual exchanges about our mutual interests, we would regularly talk about what we had for lunch, our daily struggles at school or work, and so on.

## We build community over the mundane

I remember being part of a small community of forum admins. It was mostly anime and manga forums built using phpBB 2, with some exceptions. Despite all differences between each site, they all shared something in common: the "off topic" board, a section where you could post about anything that didn't fit on the other boards. Funnily it was always the most active board of each forum. 

Between the private chats and the off topic boards, it was like having little windows onto other peoples mundane life. 20 years later those are the conversations and small exchanges I remember the most.

I couldn't give less of a fuck about people that thinks sharing the mundane on the internet is stupid. No it isn't, you are. Shut up.

## So, anyways...

I apologize for the nostalgia detour, but I wanted to bring some background for the reasons I made this blog.

Those forums-years were followed by several blogs and websites, spanning across various personal interests and moments of my life. Remembering them truly feels like looking at old photographs that captured the very essence of life's stages.

Lately a pattern has started to emerge. I've many times found myself wanting to deep dive into a subject â€”expecting to connect with others through sharing an experience or thoughtsâ€”but short social media posts aren't enough. And I don't really enjoy posting long threads.

I hope for this blog to be a mix of experimentation, writing, and to become an open window to my inner world.

The main topic is that there is no main topic. I always sucked at defining topics or themes because I can't choose just a few and let alone stick to them.

I missed having my very own piece of land on the internet.
