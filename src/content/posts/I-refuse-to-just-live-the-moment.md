title: I refuse to just "live the moment"

Phone bad. Photo bad. Video bad. <span aria-label ="live the moment bro!">LiVe thE moMenT bRo!</span>

It's a mix of things people just assume to be universally correct, and some high-morale flex attempt.

I too used to think that way, until time proved me wrong.

In 2008 I went to a concert with a friend. It was my first time seeing a big band live. It was amazing. And then I forgot almost everything about it. I mean yeah, sure, I remember I had a great time and all, but I couldn't remember speciffic moments and how they played my fav songs. Keep in mind the year: I did not have a smartphone yet, not even a dumb phone with a camera! I "lived the moment", but my memory is shit sometimes and ended up forgetting important details from that amazing concert.

The same applies to other moments of my life. The truth is that, without external support, on it's own, my memory sucks. And that's a big problem for me, because I love remembering good times with upmost detail. Of course, this isn't a constant variable that applies to my whole life. I do have many memories that didn't depend on cameras or text, but when it comes to live events and intense moments that have a heavy sensorial component... Belive me, I've learnt the hard way that not recording or taking pictures is a mistake.

I'm obviously not recording a full concert, but I'm absolutely taking some photos and recording 2 or 3 of my fav songs.

In less than 2 months I am going to see my favorite band for the first time. I've been waiting for this moment for 20 years. Imagine not capturing anything, LOL. Coudln't be me, sorry.

Besides, the part that pisses me off the most about this is how it's always presented as an axiom. Like it wasn't possible to do both things: be present enjoying the moment and capturing it through pictures or video. Holding my phone steady for two minutes isn't gonna take me off reality. Hell, I won't even look at the screen much. You can literally just hold your phone facing the stage and... Look at the stage instead of the screen... Like... Hello??

Idk, just kinda tired of this white & black thinking fueled with failed attempts at flexing what some consider to be a kind of higher values. It is in the extremes where the problem is. Filming a whole concert would be stupid, but so is forcing yourself to not capture a single thing.

I will live the moment. And I will also capture it to treasue it better.

I still look at my travels photos, and still rewatch the videos of my favorite bands playing my favorite songs. The fact that I took those videos are a token of "I was there. I lived that. I took this".
