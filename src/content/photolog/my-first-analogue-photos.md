In October 2024, I got my hands on an ’80s pocket point-and-shoot camera and decided to get some film to try it out.
I knew the photos would be of poor quality—messy, shaky, or maybe not even come out at all… but that was part of the fun.

Having so few shots available (24, to be exact) made me wary about when to use it, which ended up accidentally taking me more than a year and a half to use the whole roll. Whoops.

The first photo is the one I was the most anxious about: a picture of my late cat, which I remembered taking because it was the first shot I made with this camera. Thankfully, considering the camera’s quality, it came out pretty okay. I miss him dearly, so having a “new” photo of him feels like some kind of magic.

Anyway, here are some of my favorite photos that came out of that 110 film.
